# TODOS

* Allow managing of presets and display those in the settings screen and as quick actions
* Add way to add multiple counters per player (Make the section with the player scrollable; if there is are more than the life counter display a life button and buttons for each counter; these buttons act as tabs and when clicked they show a title above the counter and change to main to counter to that counter; also add a way pick colors and save presets for the counters and record the usage to sort these)
